# ðŸ“¨Â Spam Email Filtering
## Overview
This project is part of the **"Machine Learning"** course assignment for the Fall 2023 semester. The objective is to evaluate the adaptation and suitability of various classification algorithms for the task of spam email detection using the Ling-Spam dataset (it can be found [here](/www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data), a ``.zip`` file). The dataset contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or non-spam, with features extracted from their textual representation.
You can find more details in the [report](https://github.com/sorodocosmin/projects/blob/main/Spam_Email_Filtering/spam-email-classification/RaportSpamClassification.pdf) made.
## Methodology:
- **Data Partitioning:** The dataset is divided into 9 folders for training and 1 folder for testing.
- **Algorithm Selection:** A suitable algorithm, chosen from those studied during the course, is implemented for solving the spam classification problem.
- **Justification:** The choice of algorithm is justified theoretically and experimentally through a LaTeX [report](https://github.com/sorodocosmin/projects/blob/main/Spam_Email_Filtering/spam-email-classification/RaportSpamClassification.pdf), including comparisons with alternative candidate algorithms.
- **Cross-Validation:** Leave-One-Out cross-validation strategy is implemented to assess the algorithm's performance, with statistical results illustrated in a graph.
- **Test Set Evaluation:** The algorithm's performance on the test dataset is evaluated in terms of accuracy, ensuring its superiority over trivial strategies like random guessing.
